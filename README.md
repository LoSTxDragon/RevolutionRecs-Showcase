### A revolutionary new browser extension for truly personalized streaming recommendations.

RevolutionRecs is a privacy-first browser extension that analyzes a user's local viewing history to provide a deeply personal recommendation experience. Our goal is to replace generic platform algorithms with a tool that understands the user's unique taste in actors, directors, genres, and even decades.

### TMDb API Usage

This application uses the TMDb API to enrich a user's local viewing history with metadata such as genres, actors, directors, and release dates. This data is processed **exclusively on the user's device** to power our personalized recommendation engine.

No user viewing history or personally identifiable information is ever sent to or stored on our servers. The TMDb API is essential for providing the high-quality, nuanced recommendations that are the core feature of this tool, and we are committed to using it respectfully and in accordance with TMDb's terms of service.
