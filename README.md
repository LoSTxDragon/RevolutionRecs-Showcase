## Privacy Policy

*Last Updated: June 20, 2025*

Your privacy is our highest priority. This policy outlines what data the extension handles.

**1. Data We Handle**
The Streaming Codex works with your `Netflix-Viewing-History.csv` file, which you provide manually, and your latest viewing activity, which you can provide via our "One-Click Sync" feature.

**2. Where Your Data is Stored**
All of your viewing history data is stored **only on your local computer** using the browser's built-in storage. It is never sent to, stored on, or seen by our servers. We have no access to your viewing history.

**3. Data We Transmit**
To provide recommendations, the extension sends the *titles* of movies and shows (without any of your personal information) to The Movie Database (TMDb) API to retrieve public metadata like genres and cast.

**4. Premium Waitlist**
We offer an optional waitlist for upcoming premium features. If you choose to sign up by providing your email, it will be collected by our third-party mailing list provider. As per our promise, this list will be used for a single launch announcement and then permanently deleted.

**5. Contact Us**
If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact us at powerscodes@gmail.com.
